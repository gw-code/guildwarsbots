# GW Bots
*Builds are autoloaded, I merely give these for reference when you don't have the skills*
*PRs are very much welcome*
## Usage warning
I am not responsible for sale of any rare items.
When using bots, do not bring anything you don't want sold.

## Credits
Code for these bots was found all over GitHub, I merely gathered and refactored code.
The Destroyer one is made from scratch.
